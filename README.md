This is a collection of R/Python scripts for various functionalities.

* **get_cpg_probes_hg19.R** R script for generating a BED file that maps Illumina CpG probes to genomic coordinates and strands. This only works for hg19, for hg38 please use UCSC's liftOver tool to convert. 
* **example_getopt.py** Python script for getopt module-based command line input, can be used by copying directly into scripts.
